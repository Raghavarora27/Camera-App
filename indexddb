Indexed DB =>  database inside your browser ( No SQL ) we dont need to create it

SQL - relational database (Tables and unko relate karte h row and column se)

you can create multiple tables, tables can be related

eg - Name       college         address
     Raghav     ADGITM          delhi
     Madhav     LPS             delhi

NoSQL -> Dont need Tables,dont need relation, just need objects (JS)

Instead of Creating tables , create a collections of objects with similar kind of data

collection = [
    {Name: Raghav,College: ADGITM,address: delhi}
    {Name: Madhav,roll no: 1,address: delhi}
]

you can create multiple collections, we cannot create relations


Local Storage - Key value pair use karta h(bjects were not stored), It is used to store only strings, Maximum 5mb data can be stored

IndexedDb - Directly store objects ,any kind of data store kar sakte h , limit (2gb-3gb)

A single nosql database can contain multiple collections and in indexedDB we call these collections objectStore. If you want to create an object store you can only do that inside of the functions of the ugrade event
